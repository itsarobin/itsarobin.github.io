### Ingredients

 - 100g starter (100% hydration)
 - 450g bread flour or King Aurthor's All Purpose flour
 - 325g water
 - 10g salt

### Method

1. At 8pm the night before add all ingredients in large bowl and mix to combine. It will
   be very wet and sticky. Optionally, transfer dough to a greased bowl. Cover. Ideally
   leave in a warm place (72°F optimal)

1. At 7am the next day pre-heat your oven and stone/dutch oven to 475°F

1. At 8am, prepare a 16x16in square of parchment paper then with well floured hands
   _*GENTLY*_ transfer the dough to the center of the parchment keeping it in as much of
   a ball shape as possible. You _must_ handle the dough as little as possible. The lack
   of any kneeding means the more air bubbles that are deflated the more dense the loaf
   will be. 

1. Optional but recommended; score the top of the loaf with a razor. 1/2in deep, make
   one quick and confident slash. If the razor catches just lightly finish the score
   with a second cut. 

1. Transfer the parchment to the baking stone or the dutch oven. If you're using a dutch
   oven, cover it and move on. If you are using a baking stone for best results you should add steam
   to the oven as you're adding the loaf. This can be accomplished with a spray bottle,
   lava rock tek, or pouring water into a disposable baking pan placed under your stone.

1. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce heat to 425°F. If you are using a dutch oven remove
   the cover. 

1. Bake another 25-40 minutes until the loaf is deep golden brown.

1. Remove from oven and let cool completely before cutting. At least 1 hour.
