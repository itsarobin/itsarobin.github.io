### Ingredients

 - 9-10oz starter (100% hydration, fed 8-12 hours before or ideally at most active)
 - 15.5oz bread flour or King Aurthor's All Purpose flour
  - 5.5oz of the fliur can be replaced by whole wheat flour (you MUST sift the bran out)
 - 10oz cold water
 - 1.75tsp salt

### Method

1. Put flour in a large bowl then mix the starter into the water.

1. Slowly add the starter mixture to the flour until fully incorporated. To mix, with a completely limp wrist swirl the flour as you slowly pour the water. When a wet ball starts to form start to flip and press the dough to work all of the flour in. Alternatively you can use a stand mixer on low speed with a bread hook attachment.

1. Cover the dough and let rest for 20 minutes.

1. Add the salt and incorporate.

1. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes

1. With a bench scraper pull a small section of dough up off the side and into the center of the dough. Continue folding around the ball until you've done one rotation. 6-8 folds. Cover and rest for thirty minutes then repeat fold and rise 3 more times for a total of 4 folds over 2 hours. 

1. Gently turn dough out onto a moderately floured surface trying to get the side of the dough that was against the bowl face down on the counter.

1. Stretch into an 8-10 inch round by reaching under the dough and pulling. Be gentle and try not to deflate any bubbles. If you want a more uniform crumb deflate pockets more than 1 inch (I generally don't do this)

1. Gently fold top of dough into the center and hold. Working around the round fold each side over the last. 4 folds in total. 12, 3, 6, 9 on the clock. Roll over onto the seam, cover with greased plastic wrap, and rest for 15 minutes. 

1. Prepare couche or linen kitchen towel. Mist the bottom then generously flour the top. Place into a round/spherical colander

1. Repeat above folding process. When you flip the seam down cup between your two hands and make a few little cirles to pull the surface if the dough taught.

1. Place seam side up in the couche and fold the corners of the couche over. Place in a non-scented garbage bag and close it.

1. At this point you can place it in the fridge and col ferment up to 48 hours. 

1. Rise for 1-2 hours until doubled in bulk and the dough springs back when gently pushed with a knuckle. If you're rising out of a cold ferment this will take longer. Expect 2-3 hours at least. The dough should have risen close to the top of the colander at this point. 

1. At least an hour before baking preheat the oven to 475°F

1. Unwrap the couche and put a pizza peel or some other flat surface lined with a 16x16 inch piece of parchment on top of the collander, flip over. 

1. Create your steam chamber with the lava rock method or pouring a cup of boiling water in a disposable pan under your stone. A dutch oven may also be used but I have no experience with that technique.

1. Score as desired. I use a greased razor on a lame to make a single score on the top of the loaf. 
	- With your blade held nearly horizontal make a 1/2 inch gash into the loaf. Firmly pull the lame/blade towards you. The blade may drag if not greased enough or the blade is pulled too slowly. If you are using a lame and are going to grease your razor make sure that you take care to pull the lame so the blade pushes against the lame itself - if you imagine a line going through the center of the round, you should hold the lame so that the shaft is mostly perpendicular to that line, too parallel and the razor may slip off the lame. 

1. Transfer loaf to the stone. Bake for 15 minutes

1. Reduce heat to 425°F and bake for another 30 minutes. Or until golden to dark brown. At least 200°F internal temperature\*
	- \* The finished temp will vary depending on your altitude. @ 1550m/5085ft my done temp is around 202°F. Sea level should be 212°F

1. Let cool to room temp before cutting.
